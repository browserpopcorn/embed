1
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,740
To understand what I'm about to tell
you, you need to do something first,

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,830
you need to believe
in the impossible.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,580
Can you do that? Good.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,800
You see that red blur?

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,040
That's me.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:15,950
That too.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,850
There I am again.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,330
My name is Barry Allen.

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,050
I am the fastest man alive.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,170
My story is pretty simple.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,580
My whole life,
I have been running.

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,170
Usually from bullies.

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,650
Sometimes I escaped.

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,150
Sometimes I did not.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,370
Tell me what happened.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,390
Those guys were picking on kids Just
'cause they thought they weren't cool.

17
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,850
- It wasn't right.
- I know.

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,270
- I guess I wasn't fast enough.
- No.

19
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,340
You have such a good heart,
Barry.

20
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,730
And it's better to have a
good heart than fast legs.

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,460
Hello. I'm home.

22
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,210
- Barry got into a fight.
- Oh, yeah?

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
And he won.

24
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,520
Way to go, Slugger.

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,880
And, no more fighting.

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,480
But after that night, I was running
from something much scarier.

27
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,210
- Something I could never explain.
- Henry! Henry!

28
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,090
Something impossible.

29
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,410
Help!

30
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,780
- Mom!
- Barry, don't!

31
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,510
- Mom!
- Don't let him touch you!

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,370
Mom!

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,210
Mom!

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,130
- Nora!
- Stay back!

35
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,150
Nora, hold on!

36
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,180
Run, Barry, run!

37
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,070
Mom?

38
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,990
Dad?

39
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,850
Sorry.

40
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,310
Second robbery this week.

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,880
The teller ID'd Clyde
Mardon as the shooter.

42
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,840
What?

43
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,020
Oh, Geez,
the Mardon brothers are back.

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
What do we got?

45
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,440
Perps took the bank,
shot out the cameras,

46
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,890
and as a chaser, killed the
security guard over there.

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,800
I've got unis kicking in doors of
known Mardon brothers associates.

48
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,090
CSI been over it?

49
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,940
No.

50
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
Where's Allen?

51
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,190
Sorry! Sorry.

52
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,580
You can't keep
covering for him...

53
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,020
- CSI! CSI! Coming through.
- If he's not here now,

54
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,810
I'm gonna have to carry on
this investigation without him.

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,380
Sorry I'm late, Captain Singh.

56
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,870
What was it this time,
Mister Allen?

57
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,410
Did you forget to
set your alarm clock?

58
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,710
Before you answer,
I should remind you,

59
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,950
the excuse you gave last
time was car trouble.

60
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,550
Wanna know why that one
was particularly memorable?

61
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,940
I do not own a car.

62
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,490
He was running an errand for me.

63
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,460
Barry,
did you get me what I asked for?

64
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,870
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

65
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,440
I have it right...

66
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
here.

67
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,260
I had a few bites of it.

68
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,000
Getaway car is a
Mustang Shelby GT-500.

69
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,690
Shelby's have a rear super-wide
tire specific to that model.

70
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,780
12 inches with an
asymmetrical tread.

71
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,010
And there's something else.

72
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,290
Thanks.

73
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,360
Fecal excrement.

74
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,160
Animal, I'd guess.

75
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,340
My dad gave me that pen.

76
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,260
Before he died.

77
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,660
Sorry.

78
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,690
Ok! I am ready to see this
atom smasher smashing.

79
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,170
There was a shooting today.

80
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,580
Your dad needs me to
process some evidence,

81
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,640
which means I don't know if we're going
to be able to make it to S.T.A.R. labs.

82
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,050
But seeing this thing turn
on is like your dream.

83
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,980
Your sad, little nerdy dream.

84
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,820
Besides,
I canceled a date for this.

85
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,480
Hands off my fries.

86
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,270
Unbelievable.

87
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,180
I'm stress-eating
over my dissertation.

88
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,040
We started selling
cronuts at jitters.

89
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,810
I ate two today.
If I don't graduate soon,

90
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,690
I'm gonna be more
muffin top than woman.

91
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,770
You look amazing.

92
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,810
What is so important about this
particle accelerator anyway?

93
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,430
Harrison Wells'
work in quantum theory

94
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,050
is light-years ahead of
anything they're doing at CERN.

95
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,700
You're doing that thing where
you're not speaking English.

96
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
Okay.

97
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,730
Just imagine

98
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:06,040
that that dot is everything the human
race has ever learned until this moment.

99
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,400
Does that include twerking?

100
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,820
That is everything we could learn
from the particle accelerator.

101
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,540
It's a whole new way
of looking at physics.

102
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,570
It will literally change the way
that we think about everything.

103
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,250
You got to get
yourself a girlfriend.

104
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,310
Hey, leave him alone.
He's working.

105
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,430
Hi, Dad.

106
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,560
- Your test thingy is done.
- Yeah.

107
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,610
I think the Mardon brothers
are hiding on a farm.

108
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,310
The fecal matter I found on
the street, it was cow manure,

109
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,850
which contains traces
of oxytetracycline.

110
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,340
It's an antibiotic.

111
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,060
There are only four
farms in the area

112
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,690
in the area that still
use it in their feed.

113
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,960
Bet you find a really sweet
Shelby parked at one of them.

114
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,600
Dad, seeing as how barry
solved your poop problem,

115
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,790
how about letting him
go to S.T.A.R. labs?

116
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,500
- Fine, go.
- Yes!

117
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,950
Thank you, Joe.

118
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,540
So Barry, how was your trip?

119
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,480
Did you find proof of the
impossible in Starling City,

120
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,660
or did you just make my
dad mad for no reason?

121
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,800
Actually, while I was away,
I had a chance to think about...

122
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,580
you know, relationships.

123
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,030
And, well, I'm not in one.

124
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,990
And you're not in one, either.

125
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,870
And you're my best friend, Iris.

126
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,140
You're mine, too.

127
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,040
Why else would I be here?

128
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,460
That's not what I meant.
What I meant...

129
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,030
I know what you're gonna say,
Barry.

130
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,540
I'm not sure you do.

131
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,240
Even though we pretty much grew
up in the same house together,

132
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,350
and we're kind of like
brother and sister,

133
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,880
because we're not
brother and sister,

134
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,530
it can get really weird and
awkward to talk to me about girls.

135
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,280
But I just want you to know
that it shouldn't be awkward.

136
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,820
There is nothing that I want more
than for you to meet the right person

137
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,080
that totally loves and adores you
for the amazing guy that you are.

138
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,380
Took the words right
out of my mouth.

139
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,550
Aren't you glad I
know you so well?

140
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,090
Thank you.

141
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,860
My name is Harrison Wells.

142
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,650
Tonight, the future begins.

143
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,030
The work my team and I will do here will
change our understanding of physics.

144
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,160
We'll bring about advancements in
power, advancements in medicine.

145
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,610
And trust me, that future will
be here faster than you think.

146
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,180
Hey, my laptop!
It's got my dissertation.

147
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,880
All right, kid, you don't
have to do this, all right?

149
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,540
Just give me back my friend's
bag, and we'll call it even.

150
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Okay?

151
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,930
Barry!

152
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,140
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.

153
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,270
Freeze! Police!

154
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,210
Or do you want to find out the hard
way you're not faster than a bullet?

155
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,760
Who is that guy,
and what is he so proud of?

156
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,050
So he caught a mugger?

157
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,750
He's a transfer from Keystone.

158
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,200
Started a few weeks ago.
Eddie Thawne.

159
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,440
Oh, that's Detective Pretty Boy.

160
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,420
That's what my dad calls him.

161
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,650
Says he actually keeps score
when it comes to arrests.

162
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,510
He is pretty though.

163
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,840
This is the last
farm on Barry's list.

164
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,880
Look, I know the kid's smart,
but you said it yourself?

165
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,470
Sometimes he's
chasing flying pigs.

166
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,660
Well, let's check it out anyway.

167
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,140
I'm Linda Park, and we're
live outside S.T.A.R. Labs.

168
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,820
Despite the inclement weather,
which is only going to get worse.

169
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,730
The torrential downpour has in no way
affected the particle accelerator,

170
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,730
which is up and running smoothly
according to S.T.A.R. Labs

171
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,360
CEO Harrison Wells.

172
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,750
The weather has also...

173
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,740
Mardon.

174
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,930
I've got a plane to catch!

175
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,690
What the hell?

176
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,220
Chyre, hang in there.

177
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,720
Wait, we are now being told
to evacuate the facility.

178
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,200
The storm may have caused a malfunction
to the primary cooling system.

179
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,450
Officials are now trying to shut down
the particle accelerator, but so far,

180
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,200
have been unable to regain
control of the system...

181
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:36,830
What the hell happened to him?

182
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,730
He was hit by lightning.

183
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,020
How is he still alive?

184
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Go!

185
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,330
No heartbeat. CBC, chem 24,
type and cross four. Bag him.

186
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,140
- Coding!
- Flatlined.

187
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,750
- You can't be in here!
- I'm family!

188
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,640
- Charge the paddles to 200.
- Barry!

189
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,670
Clear!

190
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
What are you doing?

191
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,120
He likes this song.

192
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,890
How could you
possibly know that?

193
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,600
I checked his Facebook page.

194
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,640
I mean,
he can hear everything, right?

195
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,420
Auditory functions are the last
sensory faculties to degenerate.

196
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,290
Can't read my...
No he can't read my poker face

197
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,340
- Oh, my God!
- Where am I?

198
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,570
He's up!

199
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,860
Doctor Wells, get down to
the cortex, like right now.

200
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,420
Pulse 120, pupils equally
reactive to light.

201
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,490
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Hey hey. Oh, oh, relax.

202
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,970
Everything's ok, man.

203
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,310
You're at S.T.A.R. Labs.

204
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,440
S.T.A.R. Labs?
Who... who are you?

205
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,920
I'm Cisco Ramon.

206
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,790
She's Caitlin... Dr. Snow.

207
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,210
I need you to urinate in this.

208
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,300
Not this second.

209
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,450
What... what is happening?
What is going on?

210
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,510
You were struck by lightning,
dude.

211
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,860
Lightning gave me abs?

212
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,470
Your muscles should be atrophied,
but instead they're in a chronic

213
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,800
And unexplained state of
cellular regeneration.

214
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,120
Come here, have a seat.

215
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,480
You were in a coma.

216
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,410
For how long?

217
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,920
Nine months.

218
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,880
Welcome back, mister Allen.

219
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,970
We have a lot to discuss.

220
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,360
It's hard to believe I'm here.

221
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,990
I've always wanted to
meet you face to face.

222
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,020
Yeah?

223
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,820
Well, you certainly went
to great length to do it.

224
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,820
S.T.A.R. Labs has
not been operational

225
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,750
since FEMA categorized us as
a class 4 hazardous location.

226
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,420
17 people died that night.

227
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,300
Many more were injured.

228
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,980
Myself amongst them.

229
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Geez.

230
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,990
What happened?

231
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,970
Nine months ago,
the particle accelerator

232
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,140
went online exactly as planned.

233
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,370
For 45 minutes,
I had achieved my life's dream.

234
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,320
And then...
then there was an anomaly.

235
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,920
The electron volts became
unmeasurable, the ring under us popped.

236
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,230
Energy from that detonation
was thrown into the sky

237
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,890
and that,
in turn seeded a storm-cloud...

238
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,910
That created a lightning bolt
that struck me.

239
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,070
That's right.

240
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,530
I was recovering myself
when I heard about you.

241
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,390
The hospital was undergoing
unexplainable power outages.

242
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,720
Every time you were going
into cardiac arrest,

243
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,880
which was actually
a misdiagnosis

244
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,830
because you see,
you weren't flat-lining, Barry,

245
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,540
your heartbeat was moving too
fast for the EKG to register it.

246
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,570
Now, I'm not the most popular
person in town these days,

247
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,430
but detective west and his daughter
gave me permission to bring you here,

248
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,870
where we were able
to stabilize you.

249
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,450
- Iris?
- Iris, yes.

250
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,220
She came to see you quite often.

251
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,550
She talks a lot.

252
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,480
Also, she's hot.

253
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,140
- I need to go.
- No, you can't.

254
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,410
No, no, no, Caitlin's right, now that
you're awake, we need to do more tests.

255
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,020
You're still going
through changes.

256
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,570
There's so much
that we don't know.

257
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,740
I'm fine, really. I feel normal.

258
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,520
Thank you for saving my life.

259
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,950
Really?

260
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,520
Can I keep the sweatshirt?

261
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,870
- Yeah, keep the sweatshirt.
- Ok.

262
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,770
Sure.

263
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,710
- Fill 'er up?
- Thanks.

264
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,030
Oh, my God.

265
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,970
You're awake.

266
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,730
Why didn't S.T.A.R.
Labs call us?

267
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,030
I just woke up.

268
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,630
Should you even be on your feet?

269
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,240
Iris, I-I'm okay.

270
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,570
I watched you die, Barry.

271
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,490
You kept dying.
Your heart kept stopping.

272
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,580
It's still beating.

273
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,530
- Feels really fast.
-Oops.

274
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,430
Are you okay, Tracy?

275
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,750
Yeah, I got it.

276
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,970
My dad is gonna be
so happy to see you.

277
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,120
Let me get my stuff, okay?
Be right back.

278
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,130
Thank you. Thank you so much.

279
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,350
How can I help you today?

280
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,500
"This is a robbery."

281
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,020
Is this supposed to be a joke?

282
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,130
You tell me.

283
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,830
Oh, you scared the
hell out of us, kid.

284
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,160
Yeah, that was quite the nap you took
there, baby face, and you still look 12.

285
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,110
You look okay.

286
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,030
Are you really?

287
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,360
- Yeah.
- Detective West,

288
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,490
We've got a 5.15 in progress
at gold city bank, two dead.

289
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,350
Storm's really picking
up on the south side.

290
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,460
I'd grab your rain gear.

291
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,660
I'm sorry, Barry. I got to run.

292
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,190
- Do you need my help?
- No, you take it easy.

293
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,000
There'll be plenty for you
to do once you settle in.

294
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,150
Let's go, partner.

295
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,500
Hey, Allen. Glad to see you.

296
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,480
- Thanks, Eddie.
- Hey, Iris.

297
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,590
Detective, you should go.

298
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,230
My dad doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

299
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,010
Glad you're back.

300
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,500
The night of the explosion, Clyde
Mardon shot and killed Chyre.

301
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,260
Mardon and his brother
died trying to escape.

302
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,630
Their plane crashed.

303
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,450
Iris, got a minute?

304
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,410
Hey, Barry. Good to see you.

305
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,730
Screw you!

306
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
You okay?

307
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,120
I-I'm fine.

308
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,350
I-I just need some air.

309
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,860
But I'll call you tonight,
all right?

310
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,220
What's happening to me?

311
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,550
Awesome.

312
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,000
You don't really believe he
can run that fast, do you?

313
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,120
Well, I believe anything is
possible, and in a few minutes,

314
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,220
maybe you will too.

315
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,090
How does it fit?

316
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,650
It's a little snug.

317
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,860
At least you will be moving
so fast no one will see you.

318
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,520
See, you thought the
world was slowing down.

319
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,490
It wasn't.

320
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,520
You re moving so fast, it only looked
like everyone else was standing still.

321
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,650
Dr. Wells will be monitoring your
energy output, and Caitlin, your vitals.

322
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,420
What do you do?

323
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,980
I make the toys, my man.
Check it.

324
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,760
This is a two-way headset
with a camera I modified.

325
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,110
Typically designed to combat
battlefield impulse noise,

326
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,100
or in your case, potential sonic
booms, which would be awesome.

327
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,490
- What?
- Nothing.

328
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,000
I just noticed you
don't smile too much.

329
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,340
My once promising career
in bioengineering is over,

330
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,270
my boss is in a wheelchair for life,
the explosion that put you in a coma

331
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,950
also killed my fiance.

332
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,100
So this blank expression kind
of feels like the way to go.

333
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,290
Mr. Allen, while I am extremely eager to
determine your full range of abilities,

334
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,750
I do caution restraint.

335
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,020
Yeah.

336
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,710
He just passed 200
miles per hour.

337
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,750
It's not possible.

338
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,560
Mom!

339
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,910
- No, Barry!
- Mom!

340
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,430
No! Don't let him touch you!

341
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,090
What is all this?

342
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,350
Witnesses from the
robbery at Gold City Bank.

343
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,230
Perp made off with 200 grand,
more or less.

344
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,790
- Catch these guys.
- The windows blew in.

345
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,390
It was like a hurricane.

346
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,240
Everyone ran for cover.

347
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,990
We're going to have a sketch artist
work with you, if you feel up to it.

348
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,710
Third robbery in a month
where a freak storm precedes it.

349
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,700
Sounds like one of those
"Wide world of weird" cases

350
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,540
- Barry's obsessed with.
- He's not obsessed.

351
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,790
Guess you haven't read his blog.

352
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,690
The security
cameras at the bank.

353
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,130
Apparently it all shorted out.

354
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,970
We got a bunch of
witnesses here.

355
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,790
They all have cell phones.

356
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,330
The sky went black and then,
boom.

357
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,120
Outside was inside.

358
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,140
Man, it was like there was
a thunderstorm in the bank.

359
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,950
Vukuvich, suspect is
driving a black Mustang.

360
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,980
Partial plate
Six-Kilo-Charlie-Three.

361
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,770
- Put out an APB.
- Copy that.

362
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,960
It looks like you had a
distal radius fracture.

363
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,270
Had?

364
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,450
It's healed... in three hours.

365
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,040
How is that even possible?

366
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,200
We don't know...yet.

367
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,450
You really need to
learn how to stop.

368
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,660
What happened out there today?

369
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,530
You were moving pretty well, and then
something caused you to lose focus.

370
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,930
I started remembering something.

371
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,020
When I was 11,
my mother was murdered.

372
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,090
It was late.

373
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,730
A sound woke me up.

374
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,950
I came downstairs and...

375
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,260
I saw what looked like
a ball of lightning.

376
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,650
Inside the lightning,

377
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,210
there was a man.

378
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,850
He killed my mom.

379
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,290
They arrested my dad.

380
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,260
He's still sitting in Iron
Heights for her murder.

381
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,960
Everyone, the cops, the shrinks, they
all told me what I saw was impossible.

382
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,400
But what if the man who
killed my mom was like me?

383
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,680
Well, I think I can say
unequivocally you are one of a kind.

384
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,710
Can I help you, detective?

385
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,110
You can stop acting like you can't
stand me when your dad's around.

386
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,380
And I like having a boyfriend
who isn't shot to death.

387
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,280
You can't tell my dad.

388
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,090
He doesn't know
about me and Eddie.

389
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,290
Doesn't seem like
anyone's in on the secret.

390
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,010
I was gonna tell you.

391
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,070
When you were in the hospital,
Eddie covered my father's shifts

392
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,530
so that we could
both be with you.

393
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,840
I thanked him with a cup of coffee,
and things just kind of happened.

394
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,090
And it's good.

395
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,400
Dating your partner's daughter...

396
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,620
isn't that against
department regulations?

397
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,430
Why are you so upset?

398
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,660
I just don't like having to
lie to your dad, you know?

399
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,620
Barry?

400
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,510
Hey! Mardon!

401
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,130
That poor man.

402
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:19,120
The way thog came in, I have
never seen anything like it.

403
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,750
Barry! Iris.

404
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,760
I'm all right, dad.

405
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,960
What the hell were you thinking

406
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,970
- having her out here?
- No, no, no...

407
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,370
And I told you, when you see danger,
You run the other way. You're not a cop.

408
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,090
- Because you wouldn't let me.
- You're damn right.

409
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,240
Joe, I need to talk to you.

410
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,550
- It can wait.
- No, now.

411
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,460
I know who did this.

412
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,740
It's Clyde Mardon.

413
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,380
I know everybody thinks
he died in a plane crash

414
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,940
after the S.T.A.R. Labs
explosion, but he is alive.

415
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,850
All right, something
happened to him that night.

416
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,130
I... I think he can
control the weather.

417
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:58,330
The recent robberies, they all happened
during freak meteorological events.

418
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,050
And when I just confronted Mardon, the
street was instantly enveloped in fog.

419
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,440
Of course you don't believe me.

420
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,730
- You never believe me.
- Okay.

421
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,280
You want to do this now?

422
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,050
Out here? Fine.

423
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,660
Mardon is dead.

424
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,490
There is no controlling
the weather, Barry.

425
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,410
Just like there was no lightning
storm in your house that night.

426
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,840
It was your brain helping a scared
little boy accept what he saw.

427
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,030
My dad did not murder my mother.

428
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,280
Yes, he did! Your dad
killed your mother, Barry!

429
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,510
I am sorry, son!

430
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,970
But I knew it, the jury knew it,
and now he's paying for what he did.

431
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,730
- Dad, enough!
- Iris.

432
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,560
I have done my best to take care of you
since that night, and I have never asked

433
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,520
for anything in return,
not even a thank you,

434
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,290
but what I do ask now
is that you for once

435
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,040
in your life see
things as they are.

436
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,840
You're not going
to believe this.

437
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,510
We got the eyewitness sketch
of the from the bank job.

438
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,960
If I didn't know better,
I'd say that's Clyde Mardon.

439
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,080
But that's impossible.

440
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,410
He's dead, right?

441
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,010
I wasn't the only one affected by the
particle accelerator explosion, was I?

442
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,140
We don't know for sure.

443
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,020
You said the city was safe, that
there was no residual danger.

444
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,920
But that's not true, so what
really happened that night?

445
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,140
The accelerator went active, we
all felt like heroes, and then,

446
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,510
it all went wrong.

447
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,320
The dimensional
barrier ruptured,

448
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,740
unleashing unknown
energies into our world.

449
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,780
Antimatter, dark energy,
X-elements...

450
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,040
Those are all theoretical.

451
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,590
And how theoretical are you?

452
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,400
We mapped the dispersion
throughout and around central city.

453
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,810
Though we have no way of
knowing exactly what or...

454
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:54,870
who was exposed, we've been searching
for other Meta-humans like yourself.

455
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,780
"Meta-humans"?

456
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,540
That's what we're calling them.

457
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,970
I saw one today.

458
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,800
He's a bank robber,
and he can control the weather.

459
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,360
This just keeps getting cooler.

460
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,610
This is not cool.

461
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,750
All right? A man died.

462
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,690
Mardon must have gotten his
powers the same way I did.

463
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,840
From the storm cloud.

464
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,190
He's still out there.

465
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,540
We have to stop him before
he hurts anyone else.

466
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,570
Barry!

467
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,580
That's a job for the police.

468
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,630
I work for the police.

469
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,280
As a forensic assistant.

470
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,500
You're responsible for this.
For him.

471
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,520
What's important is you!

472
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,730
Not me. I lost everything.

473
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,710
I lost my company.

474
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,210
I lost my reputation.

475
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,810
I lost my freedom.

476
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:40,440
And then you broke your arm,
and it healed in three hours.

477
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:46,000
Inside your body could be a map to a
whole new world... genetic therapies,

478
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,110
vaccines, medicines,
treasures buried deep

479
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,230
within your cells and we
cannot risk losing everything

480
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,910
because you want to
go out and play hero!

481
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,710
You're not a hero.

482
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,920
You are just a young man
who was struck by lightning.

483
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,790
I didn't do this.

484
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,750
I swear to god,
I didn't do this.

485
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,120
Dad, why are they taking you?

486
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,880
- Barry, don't go in the house.
- Where's mom?

487
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,310
What's gonna happen to my son?

488
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,860
- Dad!
- Barry!

489
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,010
- Dad!
- Stay out of the house!

490
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,720
Barry!

491
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,780
Joe, you know these people?

492
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,050
My daughter's best
friends with their kid.

493
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,110
I'm sorry.

494
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,960
- Mom.
- Barry.

495
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,260
Mom!

496
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,630
So that's my story.

497
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,510
I've spent my whole life searching
for the impossible, never imagining

498
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:22,330
that I would become
the impossible.

499
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,050
So why come to me?

500
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,820
Something tells me you didn't just
run 600 miles to say "Hi" to a friend.

501
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,980
All my life,
I've wanted to just do more...

502
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,330
Be more.

503
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,200
And now I am.

504
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:46,220
And the first chance I get
to help someone, I screw up.

505
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,220
What if Wells is right?

506
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,000
What if I'm not a hero?

507
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,740
What if I'm just some guy
who was struck by lightning?

508
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,470
I don't think that bolt of
lightning struck you, Barry.

509
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,560
I think it chose you.

510
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,030
I'm just not sure I'm like you,
Oliver.

511
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,670
I don't know if I can
be some...Vigilante.

512
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,170
You can be better.

513
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,620
Because you can inspire people

514
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,070
in a way that I never could...

515
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,420
Watching over your city
like a guardian angel...

516
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,900
making a difference...

517
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,150
saving people...

518
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,010
in a flash.

519
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,270
Take your own advice.

520
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,380
Wear a mask.

521
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,070
Cool.

522
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,190
Cool.

523
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,000
I've been going over unsolved
cases from the past nine months,

524
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,950
and there's been a sharp increase in
unexplained deaths and missing people.

525
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,920
Your meta-humans have been busy.

526
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:08,940
Now, I'm not blaming you.

527
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,510
I know you didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

528
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,440
I know you all lost something.

529
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,170
But I need your help to catch Mardon
and anyone else out there like him.

530
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,150
But I can't do it without you.

531
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,100
If we're gonna do this, I have
something that might help.

532
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,740
Something I've
been playing with.

533
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,460
Designed to replace the turnouts
firefighters traditionally wear.

534
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,980
I thought if S.T.A.R. Labs could do
something nice for the community,

535
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,800
maybe people wouldn't be so
angry at Dr. Wells anymore.

536
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,500
How is it going to help me?

537
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,590
It's made of a
reinforced tri-polymer.

538
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,910
It's heat and abrasive resistant,
so it should withstand your moving

539
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,150
at high-velocity speeds.

540
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,700
And the aerodynamic design
should help you maintain control.

541
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,610
Plus, it has built-in sensors
so we can track your vitals

542
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,510
and stay in contact
with you from here.

543
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,540
Thanks.

544
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,170
Now how do we find Mardon?

545
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,860
I retasked S.T.A.R.
Labs satellite

546
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:02,940
to track meteorological
abnormalities over central city.

547
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,250
We just got a ping.

548
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,680
Atmospheric pressure dropped 20
millibars in a matter of seconds.

549
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,430
I've tracked it to a farm
just west of the city.

550
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,320
I'm not saying Mardon is alive.

551
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,270
But if he was, this is the last
place him and his brother hid out.

552
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,470
Let's go.

553
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,290
Mardon?

554
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,210
On your feet.

555
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,830
Hands on your head.

556
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,490
You got me.

557
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,080
The night of the storm,
after S.T.A.R. Labs blew,

558
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,660
after our plane went down, and
I woke up on the ground alive,

559
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,180
when I saw what I can do,
I understood.

560
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,370
I am God.

561
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,060
Shut the hell up.

562
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,580
Turn around.

563
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,400
Do you think that your
guns can stop God?

564
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,210
Why in the hell would
god need to rob banks?

565
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:14,760
You're right.

566
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,220
I've been thinking too small.

567
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,420
Barry! Barry!

568
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,780
This thing's getting closer.

569
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,300
Wind speeds are 200
miles-per-hour and increasing.

570
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,330
Barry, can you hear me?

571
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,260
Yeah. Loud and clear.

572
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,090
If it keeps up,
this could become an F5 tornado.

573
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,130
And it's headed
towards the city.

574
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,530
How do I stop it? Guys?

575
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,790
What if I unravel it?

576
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,330
How the hell are you
going to do that?

577
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,470
I'll run around it in the opposite
direction, cut off its legs.

578
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,530
He'd have to clock 700
miles-per-hour to do that.

579
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,510
Your body may not be able
to handle those speeds.

580
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,760
You'll die.

581
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,680
I have to try.

582
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:42,790
The suit's holding up.

583
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,640
- But he's not.
- He can do it.

584
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,960
I know he can do it.

585
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,430
It's too strong!

586
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,080
It's time to think big.

587
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,550
You can do this, Barry.

588
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,950
You were right.

589
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,850
I am responsible
for all of this.

590
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,650
So many people have been hurt because
of me, and when I looked at you,

591
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,480
all I saw was another
potential victim of my hubris.

592
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:30,890
And yes, I created this madness,
but you, Barry, you can stop it.

593
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,960
You can do this.

594
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:36,410
Now run, Barry, run!

595
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,700
Barry?

596
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,010
I didn't think there
was anyone else like me.

597
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,270
I'm not like you.

598
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,300
You're a murderer.

599
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,830
- Barry?
- It's over.

600
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,150
I'm okay.

601
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,880
What you can do...

602
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,510
it was the lightning bolt?

603
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,620
More or less.

604
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,870
I'm sorry, Barry.

605
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,390
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

606
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,710
And I called you crazy for
chasing the impossible.

607
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,110
But you really did see something
that night your mom died.

608
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,050
And your dad is innocent.

609
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,800
I need you to
promise me something.

610
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,700
I don't want you telling Iris about
anything you can do, any of it.

611
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,390
I want her safe.

612
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,460
Promise me.

613
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,210
Yeah.

614
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,850
Hey, Slugger.

615
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,260
You've been calling me
that since I was 11.

616
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,360
Funny thing is, I finally
got into a fight today.

617
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,210
You just got out of a coma.

618
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,300
I'm not sure you should
be picking fights.

619
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:44,990
Did you win?

620
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,170
Yeah, I did.

621
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,940
You didn't kill mom.

622
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,490
You know I know that, right?

623
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,980
You believing me is all I need.

624
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,660
You're not gonna be
in here much longer.

625
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,810
Whoever killed mom...

626
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,740
whatever killed her...

627
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,870
I think I finally have a way
to find them, to stop them.

628
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,870
Barry, we've talked about this.

629
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,930
It's time to let it go.

630
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,710
You have got to stop
worrying about me,

631
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,940
and live your life.

632
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,550
For the first time,
I feel like I finally can.

633
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:48,000
The truth is, ever since the night mom
died, I've been stuck in one place,

634
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,600
missed out on a lot of things.

635
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,410
But I'm different now.

636
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,430
I've made some new friends.

637
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,770
They're helping
me find my way...

638
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:00,060
Why is it shaped like
a lightning bolt?

639
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,700
So it's not boring.

640
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,910
To finally move forward.

641
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,780
You remember when you
wanted me to change my name

642
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:10,130
so I wouldn't have to deal with
people knowing you're my dad?

643
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,780
I'm glad they know.

644
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:21,450
I'm so proud to be your son.

645
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,190
I love you, son.

646
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,220
I love you too, dad.

647
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:54,140
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

648
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,840
A friend recently gave me
the idea for a new name.

649
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,100
And something tells me,
it's gonna catch on.
